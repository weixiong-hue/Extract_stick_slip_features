1. Overview

This code aims to extract the stick slip features of shear bands. It requires inputting the curve data of the effective friction coefficient of the shear band over time, and outputting five stick slip features of the shear band, which are the number of stick-slip events, average value of friction drop, standard deviation of friction drop, average value of recurrence time, and standard deviation of recurrence time.

2. System requirements

Please run this code on the MATLAB 2021b version software. The code does not have strict requirements for system hardware and operating environment. The author ran the code in the window10 operating environment.

3. Installation guide

The installation process of the software can be obtained on the official website of Matlab. The installation time on a regular computer is relatively long, but generally does not exceed one day.

4. Demo

The code can be run directly in the MATLAB 2021b version of the software. The code requires an input file that includes data on the effective friction coefficient of the shear band over time. We provide a file "input_data.dat" as an example. After running, the code will output a result file "output_data.txt" containing the 5 shear band stick-slip features that we are concerned about. The code runs for no more than 10 minutes on a regular computer.
